# Introduction

Welcome to the Bigcommerce Kitteh API.

You can use our API to access Bigcommerce Kitteh API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittehs, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell &amp; Ruby.

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kitteh'

api = Bigcommerce::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import 'kitteh'

api = Bigcommerce.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Bigcommerce uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Bigcommerce API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Bigcommerce expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `meowmeowmeow` with your personal API key.
</aside>

# Kittehs

## Get All Kittehs

```ruby
require 'kitteh'

api = Bigcommerce::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittehs.get
```

```python
import 'kitteh'

api = Bigcommerce.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.kittehs.get()
```

```shell
curl "http://example.com/api/kittehs"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",
    "breed": "calico",
    "fluffiness": 6,
    "cuteness": 7

    "name": "Isis",
    "breed": "unknown",
    "fluffiness": 5,
    "cuteness": 10
